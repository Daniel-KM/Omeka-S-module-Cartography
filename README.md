Cartography (module for Omeka S)
================================

[Cartography] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to annotate (to draw points,
lines, polylines, polygons, etc.) images with the [web annotation vocabulary]
and the [web annotation data model].

**This is a work in progress (ALPHA release).**


Installation
------------

This module requires the modules [Annotate].

Uncompress files and rename module folder "Cartography".

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module](http://dev.omeka.org/docs/s/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules)


Usage
-----

Simply open an item with a map, go to the tab "Cartography", and annotate.

### Ontologies

The annotations uses the [web annotation vocabulary].

The class `ogc:WKTLiteral` and the property `geo:asWKT` of the ontologies of the
[Open Geospatial consortium] are used. They may be converted into the [geovocab]
vocabulary (`ngeo:Geometry`) if needed.


Warning

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
